This repository contains the tasks completed during the Data Science internship. Each task focuses on a specific area of data analysis and prediction. The tasks completed so far are:

## 1. [Stock Market Prediction](https://github.com/anishakshyp/CodeClause/tree/main/TASK%201) -
In this task, we explore the fascinating world of stock market prediction. By utilizing the Tesla dataset and other relevant data, we delve into the analysis and prediction of stock market performance. 
Through techniques such as technical analysis, visualization, and data analysis, we aim to gain insights into potential future trends in the stock market.

## 2. [Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/anishakshyp/CodeClause/tree/main/TASK%202) -
In this task, we shift our focus to the domain of wine quality prediction. We utilize the red wine dataset and employ various machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to assess and predict the quality of the wine based on different features. 
The objective is to provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to wine quality and develop a model capable of accurately predicting wine quality based on those factors.

Feel free to explore the respective folders for each task to delve deeper into the code, methodologies, and findings.
